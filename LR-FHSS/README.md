# The LR-FHSS Frames Dataset

This dataset contains the data from two distinct experimental setups: one in an urban scenario within different environments (ranging from direct to obstructed line-of-sight conditions) and another in an aerial scenario using balloon platforms, providing clear line-of-sight. 

This dual approach allows us to assess LR-FHSS performance under varied signal propagation conditions and identify optimal deployment conditions.

The ballon dataset contains 2033 frames sent by 4 end devices during stratospheric balloons flights on May 24th, 2024. Frames were collected for 2 hours and 28 minutes.

The urban dataset contains  1132272 frames sent by 5 devices from May to October 2024.
