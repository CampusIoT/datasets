# Content


This directory contains all the codes (on Python) used to calculate the PDR and generate the plots for the mobile and statics. It's organized in a way that should be ready to run the codes directly.

In this directory you can find two subdirectories:
* figuresGenerator: This folder contains all the Python codes and the output folders.
* files: contains all the files sources files (inputs) to calculate everything necessary to calculate the information. 

A description of the files directory [can be found here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/jfraire/lr-fhss-experiments/-/blob/master/Data/RawData/README.md)

Description for each script on the figuresGenerator directory [can be found here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/jfraire/lr-fhss-experiments/-/tree/master/Analysis/figuresGenerator)
