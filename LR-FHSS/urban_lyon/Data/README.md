# Content

These three folders contain the raw and processed data of the experiments done in LR-FHSS and LoRa physical layers.
The three directories here are:
* Processed: This is the data used to generate the plots in Overleaf. Should be considered as the 'official results'
* ProcessedDeprecated: This is data from experiments that had flaws or that were later joined in a 'patchex' file
* RawData: This folder contains all the data as it was received from the UDP sniffer software.

Each directory has its own README file explaining its content.

The data presented here is already on the code directory (duplicated), is only presented here in order to maintain order and separate information.
